<p>This was my last project for the <b>Foundations</b> section. So I was very excited when I was about to finish.</p>
<p>Turns out it was easier than I thought. Mainly because of I learned a lot in the previous <a href="https://github.com/anaseig/pixel_sketch">Pixel Sketch</a> project, and I was able to transfer what I've learned in this project.</p>

<p>All I needed is to push myself a bit harder to come up with a logic and of course help from the Odin Community</p>

<p>It took me 14 days and <b>18 hours</b> of work to finish.</p>
