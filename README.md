<p>This was my last project for the <b>Foundations</b> section. So I was very excited when I was about to finish.</p>
<p>I thought this project would be very hard, but turns out it was easier than I thought. Mainly because of I learned a lot in the previous <a href="https://github.com/anaseig/pixel_sketch">Pixel Sketch</a> project, and I was able to transfer what I've learned in this project.</p>
<p>All I needed is to push myself a bit harder to come up with a logic and of course, some help from the <a href="https://discord.gg/fbFCkYabZB">Odin Community</a>. <br>
<br>
I know it is not perfect, and still it needs some improvements, so I will be looking forward to update this.</p>

## The Code Structure
- <b>Variables</b> <br>
	- selector variables
	- calculation logic variable
- <b>Button Action</b> <br>
	- what each button will do
	- changes to be made when pressed
- <b>Functions</b> <br> 
	- operation function
	- operate function
	
<br>
<p>It took me 14 days to finish, working <b>18 hours</b> in total.</p>

## Thoughts
Now that I have finished the Foundations section at TheOdinProject, I feel very confident to learn and build what's next to come in the curriculum! <br>
I am enjoying the journey, let's see what happens :)
